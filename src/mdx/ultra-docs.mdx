### [Anatomy of an Ultra project](#anatomy-of-an-ultra-project)

This is the bare minimum for an **Ultra** project.

- [server.ts](#serverts)
- [src/app.tsx](#srcapptsx)
- [importMap.json](#importmapjson)
- [deno.json](#denojson)

#### server.ts

This code runs Ultra's server:

```javascript
import ultra from "https://deno.land/x/ultra/mod.ts";

await ultra();
```

#### importMap.json

Here we include the dependencies of the project:

```javascript
{
  "imports": {
    "react": "https://esm.sh/react@18",
    "react-dom": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18",
    "react-dom/server": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18/server",
    "react-helmet": "https://esm.sh/react-helmet-async?deps=react@18",
    "wouter": "https://esm.sh/wouter?deps=react@18",
    "swr": "https://esm.sh/swr?deps=react@18",
    "ultra/cache": "https://deno.land/x/ultra@v0.8.0/cache.js",
    "app": "./src/app.tsx"
  }
}
```

The above imports are all required to run **Ultra**. You can add other dependencies here, and use the import keys as an import alias in your project code ([see import maps section in the Deno manual](https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/import_maps)).

`app` is the entry point to your application. It can live anywhere in the `src` directory. It can be `jsx` or `tsx`.

#### src

All of your project code should live in the `src` directory. The only requirement is an `app.tsx/jsx` file, which is included in your importmap above. Feel free to structure your project how you like. Static files (css, images, etc) can be placed in this directory as well, and will be served as the `root` of your domain.

#### src/app.tsx

```javascript
import React,  from "react";
import { SWRConfig } from "swr";
import { Link, Route, Switch } from "wouter";
import { Helmet } from "react-helmet";
import ultraCache from "ultra/cache";
import { Cache } from "https://deno.land/x/ultra/src/types.ts";

const options = (cache: Cache) => ({
  provider: () => ultraCache(cache),
  suspense: true,
});

export default const Ultra = ({ cache }: { cache: Cache }) => {
  return (
    <SWRConfig value={options(cache)}>
      <Helmet>
        <title>Ultra</title>
      </Helmet>
      <main>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/">
            <h1>Homepage</h1>
          </Route>
          <Route>
            <h1>404</h1>
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </main>
    </SWRConfig>
  );
};
```

1. File extensions are important. Always include `.tsx`/`.jsx` in your import statements.
2. The `ultraCache` function populates the server-side cache and rehydrates the client-side cache. It is not needed unless you are using Suspense or SWR.

#### deno.json

Using the native [Deno config](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/configuration_file), ensure you specify your importMap path here, as well as any common tasks.

```javascript
{
  "tasks": {
    "dev": "mode=dev deno run -A --unstable server.js",
    "start": "deno run -A --unstable server.js",
    "cache": "deno cache --reload server.js",
    "vendor": "importMap=importMap.json deno run -A --unstable https://deno.land/x/ultra/vendor.ts",
  },
  "importMap": "importMap.json"
}
```

Defined Tasks:

- dev - always forces new imports of ESM files.
- start - production mode that uses cached ESM imports.
- cache - refreshed the deno cache for server.js.
- vendor - see [Vendoring](#vendoring) below.

Permissions:

In production, instead of `-A`, define all the utilized permissions with appropriate values to take full advantage of [Deno's permission-based security](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/permissions). Ultra uses the following permissions: allow-net, allow-read, allow-run, allow-env, allow-write.
- To specify `--allow-env` add these **Ultra** used environmental variables to the list of custom ones that you use (in a comma-separated list):
  - mode - deployment mode. "dev" is default. All other modes are considered production.
  - port - the port the server is run on; 8000 is the default.
  - source - the name of the source directory; "src" is the default.
  - vendor - the name of the vendor directory; "vendor" is the default.
  - config - path to the configuration file; "./deno.json" is the default.
  - root - the base url; "http://localhost:8000" is the default.
  - lang - the site's language; "en" is the default.
  - disableStreaming - whether streaming is disabled. It is 0 by default, meaning that it is not disabled.
  - api - the relative directory for api files; "src/api" is the default.
  - vendor - the directory where vendor files are stored inside of the `.ultra` folder; "x" by default.
  - importMapPath - the path to the import map file; "importMap.json" is the default.
- To specify `--allow-read` , add `./.ultra,./importMap.json` to the list of directories or files that you use.
- To specify `--allow-write`, add `./.ultra` to the list of directories or files that you use.
- To specify `--allow-net`, add `https://deno.land/x/ultra/` to the list of internet Urls that you use.
- To specify `--allow-run`,add `esbuild` to the list of sub-processes that you may run.

### [Suspense data fetching](#suspense-data-fetching)

Vercel's [SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr) lets us fetch data anywhere in our components and works with Suspense. **Ultra** uses the brand new **SWR 1.0.0+**.

All **SWR** options are supported [SWR docs](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/options#options).

```javascript
import { SWRConfig } from "swr";
import ultraCache from "ultra/cache";

const options = (cache) => ({
  provider: () => ultraCache(cache),
  suspense: true,
});

const Ultra = ({ cache }) => {
  return (
    <SWRConfig value={options(cache)}>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </SWRConfig>
  );
};
```

---

### [Routing](#routing)

Powered by [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter). **Wouter** is fully-featured, tiny (1.36 KB), and the best React router that we've ever used. **Ultra** comes with a server side integration which allows full functionality of **Wouter**.

All **Wouter** hooks and functionality is supported [Wouter docs](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter#wouter-api).

```javascript
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { Route } from "wouter";

const Home = lazy(() => import("./home.jsx"));

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Route path="/">
       <Home />
    </Route>
  );
};
```

---

### [Head](#head)

Powered by [react-helmet-async](https://github.com/staylor/react-helmet-async). It is used to add markup to the `html` `<head>` element such as `<title>`, `<meta>` and `<link>` tags.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Helmet } from "react-helmet";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Helmet>
      <title>Ultra</title>
    </Helmet>
  );
};
```

---

### [Vendoring](#vendoring)

During development, it's helpful to utilise CDNs like `esm.sh`, `unpkg.com`, and `deno.land/x` to serve your projects dependencies. When deploying to production, you may want to forego the CDNs and serve your dependencies locally. We have a script for doing this encapsulated in the `vendor` task defined in `deno.json`:

```bash
importMap=importMap.json deno run -A --unstable https://deno.land/x/ultra/vendor.ts
```

This will download a complete graph of your dependencies to a `.ultra/x` directory, as well as create a `vendorMap.json` import map file. You can then define this new import map in your `deno.json` file to swap to local dependencies.

> As of v0.8.0, all projects deployed to Deno Deploy will have this feature enabled by default.

---

### [Deploying](#deploying)

#### With Deno Deploy

**Ultra** supports the official [Deno Deploy GitHub Action](https://deno.com/blog/deploy-static-files)!

1. Create a project in the Deno Deploy Dashboard
2. Select `GitHub Action` integration
3. Add the following action to your project. (Note to update the `root` and `project name`)

> Note: Deno Deploy does **NOT** support dynamic imports (yet). If you are using these for routing, the project will not deploy.

```yaml
name: deno deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - name: Clone repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Deno
        uses: denoland/setup-deno@main
        with:
          deno-version: 1.20.3

      - name: Build site
        run: root=https://example.com deno run -A https://deno.land/x/ultra/build.ts

      - name: Upload to Deno Deploy
        uses: denoland/deployctl@v1
        with:
          project: [PROJECT_NAME]
          entrypoint: ULTRA.js
          root: .ultra
```

#### With Docker/Fly

`dockerfile`

```bash
FROM denoland/deno:1.20.3
EXPOSE 8000
WORKDIR /ultra
COPY . .
RUN deno task cache
CMD ["deno", "task", "start"]
```
